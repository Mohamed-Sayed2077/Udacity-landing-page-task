# Landing Page Project

    I created a function to create a link for each section.

    I Added a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.

    I wrote a code to track the active section and give it special active class, also made the link for this section in the navbar is active

    I wrote a code to Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling
